This repository contains Java solutions to common software developer interview questions involving data structures and algorithms.
Solutions are written in Java.
Each Java class in this repository contains methods that solve a particular problem. I usually write various solutions to each problem, and each method represents one of those solutions.
To test the solutions, you will need to create your own main program and/or test suite.
